### What is a Recommender System?

A recommender system gathers every bit of information about the users, sorts them out, studies, and helps in providing an immersive user experience. Say, for example, if your recent online activity shows that you have purchased NYY accessories including T-shirt, cap, keychain, etc. or searched for the best NYY moments or bought tickets to the next NYY match, then it all sums up one conclusion that you are a hard-core New York Yankees fan.

So next time you visit an online store like Amazon, you’ll be shown all the deals and offers related to NYY merchandise, and you’ll also start receiving all the latest news about the Yankees. This is all possible because of the recommender system. The main aim of a recommender system is to provide users with a meaningful recommendation for products and services based on their interests.

### How Are Recommendation Systems Build?

Today most of the modern methodologies used to build these recommender system models are mainly based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering along with incorporating the other recent advancements in machine learning space for enhanced user experience.

Collaborative filtering is one of the most popular filtering techniques that recommend products based on an opinion from other users having a similar taste. On the other hand, the content-based filtering mainly relies on the purchase or search history of that particular user. To find common ground between these two filtering techniques, another filtering technique called hybrid filtering was introduced, which brilliantly combines different filtering techniques to increase the accuracy of the recommendations made.

### How Does A Recommendation System Work?

The modus operandi behind the recommender system is simple to understand and is as follows:

1. At the fundamental level, it collects user data

2. Sort, analyze the data and identify the common patterns

3. Extract insights and meaningful, relevant information from the data

4. Mix and match data to calculate the probabilities based on the patterns

5. Provide the best recommendations to end users

There are plenty of articles covering the basics of how popular filtering algorithms work if interested, a good read for example is the recent article of Baptiste Rocca in Towards Data Science [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-recommender-systems-6c66cf15ada). However, the filtering is just the start of a complete recommender system design. For example, among the many other aspects to consider are the evaluation mechanisms, interface design, and functional design considerations.

### The popularity of Canvas for Supporting Design Tasks

It was the release of the business model canvas in 2008 by Osterwalder that brought the concept of designing canvas into the limelight and today they are being used for developing various applications including gamification models etc.

The main reason that canvases are so popular and can prove to be very helpful while creating design tasks is because they describe complex objects visually instead of simple text documents. A canvas structures every component in several blocks, hence, taking a look at the chart will give some sense about the gist of the project.

### Why Should You Use the Recommender System Canvas?

The recommender system canvas model helps design engineers, project managers in identifying the areas that are relevant to the design of the system. The model is divided into six different blocks that form the core of the recommender system design. It provides system engineers with the first critical entry point in developing a full-fledged business model. A recommender system canvas is a base from which people design intriguing business models and system designs for online news websites, computer games, social media channels, and even stock trading support systems.

### The main reasons a recommender canvas should be used are:

· The recommender system analyses the user behaviors, choices and opinions and hence creates a personalized experience for the customer

· The recommendations help the customer in taking the right decision, and this consumer satisfaction leads to customer retention.

· It helps to find out how similar products are ‘similar’ or ‘different’ to each other, and eventually, they might appeal to the same users who bought it earlier.

· In the end, a good recommendation system helps to generate more revenue by customer retention and sometimes results in additional or more frequent buying.

### Recommendation System Design

The recommender system design is built based on six areas of research as described below:

i. Goals

ii. Domain Characteristics

iii. Functional Design Consideration

iv. Filtering Technique

v. Interface Design

vi. Evaluation & Optimization

Let’s look at a detailed description of each area:
